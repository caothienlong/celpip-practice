      "content": "Dear Grandpa,\n\nThank you so much! I was surprised and delighted to receive your parcel and open your thoughtful present. A two-person camping tent is just what I needed. I've used it already; my friend Ryan and I spent a week camping in the Kootenay region of BC. We just got back. I was going to use our old family tent, but it's not only too big, it is also getting pretty worn out, so your gift was perfect.\n\nWe planned on camping at various locations in the Kootenay region, but we ended up staying at our first campsite for the whole trip. The campground, located on the east side of Arrow Lake, was called McDonald Creek Provincial Park. We were looking forward to the white sand beach, but when we arrived, the park ranger informed us that all the recent rainfall had caused the lake to flood a couple metres higher than normal. The beach was completely submerged. We still had a great time, though, hiking in the beautiful wilderness.\n\nWe drove a different route to get home so we could pass through the city of Nelson. It looks different from the last time I was there, but that's not too surprising; I was there just a couple times as a kid. Last time we were there, Dad showed me the house where he had been born, and also your old clothing store. I drove around and I couldn't find your old house, Grandpa; however, I did find your old store! It's a cafe now, but they kept your old shop sign as a decoration in the cafe. I got pretty emotional when I saw it. I felt really proud of our family history.\n\nNow I'm back in Calgary, but the trip to Nelson made me realize how much I miss you. So, I was thinking that maybe I should fly over to visit you. I have 2 weeks before college starts, so I could come for a week or so. I have enough money saved up from my summer job to pay for the ticket to Montreal. How does that sound? Perhaps the two of us can go camping like in the old days. We haven't done that since you moved east. I'll bring the new tent!\n\nLove, Greg"

After all, we have to put the tent to good use! You just email me your travel plans. Also, there's no need to __DROPDOWN_9__. I can take care of that, you should keep your savings for tuition.\n\nWell, I can't say I've been to Nelson since I sold my business there many years ago. Did you take any photos of __DROPDOWN_10__? If you did, I'd love to see them. I'm sorry you __DROPDOWN_11__. I don't even know if it's still standing. If it is, it would be a hundred years old.\n\nAnyway, email me as soon as you book the flight over here.\n\nGrandpa",
