I hope you're settling into our neighborhood. You said you were looking for __DROPDOWN_1__. I saw a few possibilities in the latest Burnaby Parks and Recreation brochure. I remember you saying that Alex is contemplative __DROPDOWN_2__ seems a great choice for thinkers like Alex. He will get to think hard and learn some additional math skills.\n\nYou said Melissa is quite scared of math, in which case you could check out __DROPDOWN_3__. They may help her feel better about her schoolwork.\n\nSpeaking of Melissa, she may want to join my daughter Cindy in the young teens' soccer league. This is quite a commitment as there is __DROPDOWN_4__. If that's a problem, she could try karate. I'm not sure about the class times __DROPDOWN_5__. You'll have to call and ask.\n\nCheers,\nSandy",
