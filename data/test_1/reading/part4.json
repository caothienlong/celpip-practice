      "title": "Science Education and Climate Change",
      "content": "Stephanie Lee is a science teacher at Ryerson Secondary who believes that real science should encourage critical thinking, even if it means challenging what's written in the textbook. Part of the curriculum involves learning about climate change, and Lee was dismayed to find the textbook material to be \"little more than propaganda, which claims that global warming is chiefly a human-caused phenomenon.\"\n\nLee argues that education is supposed to teach students how to see objectively, yet textbooks often monopolize certain viewpoints and push them as the only truth. In the case of climate change, Lee was appalled to find that no alternative theories were presented. \"The absence of other perspectives seems to indicate that the topic of global warming has been made into a sort of doctrine which seeks to diminish the credibility of other points of view,\" Lee says. Lee taught her students additional perspectives. Not only did she teach the theory of anthropogenic global warming, that is, that global warming is caused by human consumption of fossil fuels and the release of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, but also taught that throughout history, the earth's temperature has naturally risen and fallen.\n\nOther science teachers at Lee's school have raised concerns that Lee's approach is only confusing students. Carol Harvey argues that the greenhouse gas effect and subsequent global warming is not a controversy in the scientific community. It has been proven that humans have increased the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere by roughly 30% in the last 100 years. \"Our textbooks are up to date, and Lee is only prompting students to dismiss valuable textbook information,\" Harvey says.\n\nLee disagrees, asserting that science should not shy away from evaluating multiple perspectives. \"Carbon dioxide changes have not been proven to be the primary cause of global warming,\" Lee says. \"In fact, research indicates the reverse might be happening: global warming might be causing changes in carbon dioxide levels. Either way, my job is to help students to analyze both theories, not simply accept the one presented in the textbook.\""
