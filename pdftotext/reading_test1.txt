Practice Test 1 - Reading Part 1: Reading Correspondence
Read the following message.
Dear Grandpa,

Thank you so much! I was surprised and delighted to receive your parcel and open your
thoughtful present. A two-person camping tent is just what I needed. I've used it already;
my friend Ryan and I spent a week camping in the Kootenay region of BC. We just got
back. I was going to use our old family tent, but it's not only too big, it is also getting
pretty worn out, so your gift was perfect.

We planned on camping at various locations in the Kootenay region, but we ended up
staying at our first campsite for the whole trip. The campground, located on the east side
of Arrow Lake, was called McDonald Creek Provincial Park. We were looking forward
to the white sand beach, but when we arrived, the park ranger informed us that all the
recent rainfall had caused the lake to flood a couple metres higher than normal. The
beach was completely submerged. We still had a great time, though, hiking in the
beautiful wilderness.

We drove a different route to get home so we could pass through the city of Nelson. It
looks different from the last time I was there, but that’s not too surprising; I was there just
a couple times as a kid. Last time we were there, Dad showed me the house where he had
been born, and also your old clothing store. I drove around and I couldn’t find your old
house, Grandpa; however, I did find your old store! It’s a cafe now, but they kept your
old shop sign as a decoration in the cafe. I got pretty emotional when I saw it. I felt really
proud of our family history.

Now I'm back in Calgary, but the trip to Nelson made me realize how much I miss you.
So, I was thinking that maybe I should fly over to visit you. I have 2 weeks before college
starts, so I could come for a week or so. I have enough money saved up from my summer
job to pay for the ticket to Montreal. How does that sound? Perhaps the two of us can go
camping like in the old days. We haven’t done that since you moved east. I’ll bring the
new tent!

Love, Greg

Practice Test 1 - Reading Part 3: Reading for Information
Read the following passage.

A. The first record of chewing gum dates back to Finland about 5,000 years ago.
Neolithic-period chewing gum was made of bark tar and was widely utilized for its
antiseptic and medicinal properties. In America, chewing gum was first introduced to
settlers by the American Indians who chewed resin made from the sap of spruce trees.
After World War II chewing gum was made of a latex sap substance called chicle, which
has been steadily engineered and replaced by synthetic rubbers and artificial sweeteners
that allow for greater flavouring, colouring, and texture. Modern chewing gum hardly
resembles its predecessors in appearance and flavour. It has also gained unprecedented
popularity, becoming a 20-billion-dollar industry in North America.

B. Over the past decades, the bad reputation chewing gum earned for causing cavities and
gum disease has also begun to dwindle. With the advent of sugarless chewing gum, most
dentists today deem chewing gum in moderation to be harmless, or even potentially
beneficial to oral hygiene. In addition, functional chewing gum, a special category of
gum that imparts a practical function in addition to, or as a replacement for, the usual
enjoyment provided by a confectionery gum, has become increasingly prescribed by
dentists and doctors alike. Conditions such as bad breath and tobacco addictions are now
commonly treated with functional gum. Surgeons also prescribe functional chewing gum
for patients recovering from gastrointestinal surgeries.

C. Recent research suggests the benefits of gum may not be limited to medicated gum.
Chewing regular gum has been found to boost cognitive performance in many ways
including improved reaction time, motor control, and alertness. These effects have been
found to come at an expense, however. Although as many as eight areas of the brain are
activated by the simple act of chewing gum, the cognitive gains of mastication-induced
arousal can only be sustained for a short period. Moreover, chewing gum was observed to
interfere with verbal-fluency and short-memory tasks.

D. Oral health researchers posit the short-lived cognitive gains of chewing gum pale in
comparison to their potentially hazardous health effects. They claim the innocuousness of
sugarless gum is a myth, expounding that sugar substitutes such as aspartame have been
increasingly linked to different types of cancer and autoimmune diseases. They also point
to possible chronic irreversible conditions that may ensue from excessive gum chewing
such as headaches, tightness in jaw muscles and nerves, metabolic imbalances, and

irregularities in mastication that range from tooth decay to bone loss.

E. Not given in any of the above paragraphs.

@ Decide which paragraph, A to D, has the information
given in each statement below. Select E if the
information is not given in any of the paragraphs.

vy -1. Evidence suggests gum chewing can
enhance some brain functions.

Y -2. The chemical bases of chewing gum have
been reformulated.

y  -3, Chewing gum is used post-operatively as a
healing aid.

Y -4. There can be lifelong damage associated
with regular intake of synthetic sugars.

vy -5, Chewing gum can curb some unhealthy
dependence behaviours.

Y - 6, Some researchers oppose the reported
benefits of chewing gum.

y  -7, Patients who chew gum regularly tend to be
more neglectful of their oral hygiene.

Y  -8. Early chewing gum was entirely natural.

y -9The benefits of sugar-free gum are
recognized.

Practice Test 1 - Reading Part 4: Reading for Viewpoints
Read the following article from a website.

Stephanie Lee is a science teacher at Ryerson Secondary who believes that real science
should encourage critical thinking, even if it means challenging what's written in the
textbook. Part of the curriculum involves learning about climate change, and Lee was
dismayed to find the textbook material to be "little more than propaganda, which claims
that global warming is chiefly a human-caused phenomenon."

Lee argues that education is supposed to teach students how to see objectively, yet
textbooks often monopolize certain viewpoints and push them as the only truth. In the
case of climate change, Lee was appalled to find that no alternative theories were
presented. "The absence of other perspectives seems to indicate that the topic of global
warming has been made into a sort of doctrine which seeks to diminish the credibility of
other points of view," Lee says. Lee taught her students additional perspectives. Not only
did she teach the theory of anthropogenic global warming, that is, that global warming is
caused by human consumption of fossil fuels and the release of carbon dioxide into the
atmosphere, but also taught that throughout history, the earth's temperature has naturally
risen and fallen.

Other science teachers at Lee's school have raised concerns that Lee's approach is only
confusing students. Carol Harvey argues that the greenhouse gas effect and subsequent
global warming is not a controversy in the scientific community. It has been proven that
humans have increased the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere by roughly
30% in the last 100 years. "Our textbooks are up to date, and Lee is only prompting
students to dismiss valuable textbook information," Harvey says.

Lee disagrees, asserting that science should not shy away from evaluating multiple
perspectives. "Carbon dioxide changes have not been proven to be the primary cause of
global warming," Lee says. "In fact, research indicates the reverse might be happening:
global warming might be causing changes in carbon dioxide levels. Either way, my job is
to help students to analyze both theories, not simply accept the one presented in the
textbook."
